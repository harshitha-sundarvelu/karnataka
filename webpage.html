        <p>Karnataka is a state in the south western region of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state corresponds to the Carnatic region. The capital and largest city is Bengaluru.
		Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the south. It is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other 4 southern Indian sister states.
		The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha and Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in South Karnataka.
		The state of Karnataka is one of the prominent tourism hubs in India. However, tourism is just one of the facets of Karnataka. Feel the caress of Mysore silk or the fragance of sandalwood, experience the living ruins of Hampi or just delight in the simple yet sophisticated wooden toys from Channapatna.</p>
